            My name is Anthony Irizarry. I was born and raised in the greatest city in the world, New York City. I am a father of three beautiful kids, Mikaela 17, Matthew 14 and Michael 13.

            I really don't have any hobbies beacause I am always working trying to support my family and make sure they are well taken of. But, other than that, I am a person that strives to be the best father and husband that I can be.

            In conclusion being perfect is not a option. Just like the game of baseball you must learn how to swing and catch before you go on the field. So this boot camp is challenging and not easy. THAT'S HOW LIKE IT. TIL NEXT TIME PEACE!
